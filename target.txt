first target:
Goals:
Make black squares randomly, ?done by making an invincible object hold random coordinates.? //one of possible methods
When clicked the program checks for matching coordinates. 
If matching paints black and stops game, else paints white an continues.

Ideas:
red square are marked when you right click. {
	add on the right click method the coordinate to variables(for later comparison) and paint red
	}
A red square will remain red for the rest of the game.
When left clicking before anything it checks if the sqare is red, if it is everything else is ignored.{
	done inserting a boolean when you left click, insert in the if/ese checking tree
	boolean comes from a subclass that compares coordinates with variables and returns true or false accordingly
	}


All titleset start gray.
if leftclicked and no mines are found, titleset goes white.

algorithim to find adjacent clear titleset.
